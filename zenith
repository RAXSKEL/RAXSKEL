The Lost Key

Maya always carried a little silver key on her necklace, a gift from her grandmother. "It unlocks something special," her grandmother used to say, though she never explained what. Maya had worn it every day since.

One rainy afternoon, Maya reached for the necklace and felt her heart dropâ€”the key was gone. She searched everywhere: her room, her bag, retraced her steps in the street, but it was nowhere to be found.

Disappointed, she sat by the window, watching the rain. Then, something caught her eye. A soft glint, just under the bed. She crawled over and, with a gasp, found the key. But beneath it, hidden away for years, was an old, dusty box.

With trembling hands, Maya used the key. It fit perfectly. Inside was a bundle of letters, her grandmother's handwriting clear on every page. They were letters to Maya, filled with stories, advice, and love.

Maya smiled, holding the key tightly. She had finally unlocked something special.
